## Test our custom LSP1 Delegate forwarder

Now that all the pieces are connected, we can try it out!

The expected behaviour is that **everytime the UP on which the custom LSP1 Delegate contract has been set receives an allowed token (either through `transfer` or `mint`), it will automatically send a percentage to the specified receiver.**

Here are the test data:

- I set up the custom LSP1 Delegate contract on a test UP (neo: `0xD62940E95A7A4a760c96B1Ec1434092Ac2C4855E`)
- I created a custom LSP7 token named "My USDC" with symbol "MUSDC" (LSP7: `0x63890ea231c6e966142288d805b9f9de7e0e5927` / owner neo / 20k pre-minted to neo)
- The custom LSP1 Delegate contract will send 20% of the received (transfer or mint) MUSDC
- The recipient will be another test UP (karasu: `0xe5B9B2C3f72bA13fF43A6CfC6205b5147F0BEe84`)
- The custom LSP1 Delegate contract is deployed at address `0x4f614ebd07b81b42373b136259915b74565fedf5`

Let's go to [the test dapp](https://up-test-dapp.lukso.tech/) and connect with neo's profile.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    alt="TestConnectNeo"
/>
</div>

Click on "Refresh tokens" to see our `MUSDC` balance.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    alt="TestRefreshTokens"
/>
<img
    src="/img/guides/lsp1/TestPreMint.png"
    alt="TestPreMint"
/>
</div>

Use the "Mint" box to mint an additional 10k `MUSDC` to ourself (to neo's UP). This should trigger the custom LSP1 Delegate forwarder and send 20% of 10k (= 2k) to karasu.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img
    src="/img/guides/lsp1/TestMintTx.png"
    alt="TestMintTx"
/>
</div>

We will then disconnect neo's profile from the test dapp.

:::note

There is a bug currently on the test dapp where the `disconnect` button doesn't work properly. In order to disconnect from the dapp, we need to remove the connection from the "connections" tab by clicking the ‚ùå icon on the right.

We connect karasu's profile to the test dapp

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img
    src="/img/guides/lsp1/TestConnectKarasu.png"
    alt="TestConnectKarasu"
/>
</div>

... click on "Refresh tokens" and ...

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img
    src="/img/guides/lsp1/TestSuccess.png"
    alt="TestSuccess"
/>
</div>

... Success üéâ ! Our custom LSP1 Delegate forwarder worked as expected!

## Congratulations ü•≥

You now have a fully functional custom LSP1 Delegate contract that will automatically forward a certain amount of the allowed received tokens to another UP!
